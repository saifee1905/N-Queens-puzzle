# N-Queens-puzzle
  The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

  This algorithm is designed using recursion.

# About the Project :
  Actullay this project is implementation of N-queens Algorithm which is make learnt at time of learning 
  recursion and backtracking in DSA which is very important Algo.
   
  And the project is simply designed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only
